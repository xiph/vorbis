WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes libvorbis, a full-featured example
encoder/player to demonstrate use of libvorbis and documentation on
the Ogg Vorbis audio coding format.

Directory:

./lib  		The source for libvorbis, a GPLed inplementation of 
		the public domain OggSquish Vorbis audio encoding
		format.

./cmdline	A full-featured command line encoder/decoder/player
		utility ('vorbis') that demonstrates programmatic use
		of libvorbis.

./docs          Vorbis specification documents

WHAT IS VORBIS:

Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without royalty or
patent concerns.

This package contains libvorbis, a GPLed software implementation of
the Vorbis specification by the Xiphophorus company (http://www.xiph.org/).

CONTACT:

The OggSquish homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/OggSquish'.
Vorbis's homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/OggSquish/vorbis.html'.
Up to date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.

BUILD:

A standard build should consist of nothing more than:

./configure
./make 

and as root if desired :

./make install

This will install the ogg vorbis commandline encoder/player ('ogg')
into /usr/local/bin, the ogg player and libvorbis manpages into
/usr/local/man/ and libvorbis.a into /usr/local/lib.
