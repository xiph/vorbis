NEW AND IMPORTANT:

If you're used to the source distribution from the first two beta
relaeases, things are now rearranged a bit.  Specifically, the
'vorbis' CVS module contains only the libvorbis, libvorbisfile, and
libvorbisenc libraries.  Because Ogg bitstreams are to be used by other 
Ogg codecs, Ogg framing and streaming functionality is now in libogg 
(the 'ogg' CVS module).  Vorbis utilities are in 'vorbis-tools' and various
player plugins are in 'vorbis-plugins'.  For now, you'll need to check
out these other modules seperately. (Note: the xmms plugin is in the xmms
CVS tree in xmms/Input/vorbis.)

Secondly, the Ogg/Vorbis build systems now use automake.  Instead of
'./configure; make', the proper build sequence (in each module) is
'./autogen.sh; make'.

You will also need the newest versions of autoconf, automake, and libtool
in order to compile vorbis from CVS.  configure scripts are provided for you
in tarball distributions.

WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes libvorbis and an example
encoder/player to demonstrate use of libvorbis and documentation on
the Ogg Vorbis audio coding format.

Directory:

./lib  		The source for the libraries, an LGPLed inplementation of 
		the public domain Ogg Vorbis audio encoding
		format.

./include       Library API headers

./debian        Rules/spec files for building Debian .deb packages

./doc           Vorbis documentation

./examples	Example code illustrating programmatic use of libvorbis, 
		libvorbisfile and libvorbisenc

./mac 		Codewarrior project files and build tweaks for MacOS.

./win32		Win32 projects files and build automation

./vq 		Internal utilities for training/building new LSP/residue 
		and auxiliary codebooks.

WHAT IS VORBIS:

Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without royalty or
patent concerns.

This package contains:

.) libvorbis, an LGPLed software implementation of
the Vorbis specification by the Xiphophorus company
(http://www.xiph.org/) 

.) libvorbisfile, an LGPLed convenience library
built on Vorbis designed to simplify common uses and a number of GPL
example programs

.) libvorbisenc, an LGPL library that provides a simple, programmatic
encoding setup interface 

.) example code making use of libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile and
libvorbisenc

CONTACT:

The Ogg homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/'.
Vorbis's homepage is located at 'http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/'.
Up to date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.

BUILDING FROM CVS:

./autogen.sh
make 

and as root if desired:

make install

This will install the vorbis libraries (static and shared) into
/usr/local/lib, includes into /usr/local/include and API manpages
(once we write some) into /usr/local/man.

BUILDING FROM TARBALL DISTRIBUTIONS:

./configure
make

and optionally (as root):
make install

BUILDING RPMS:

after normal configuring:

make dist
rpm -ta libvorbis-<version>.tar.gz
