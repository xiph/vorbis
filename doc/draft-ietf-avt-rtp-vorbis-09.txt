Internet-Draft          Vorbis RTP Payload Format               Feb 2008


1.  Introduction

   Vorbis is a general purpose perceptual audio codec intended to allow
   maximum encoder flexibility, thus allowing it to scale competitively
   over an exceptionally wide range of bitrates.  At the high quality/
   bitrate end of the scale (CD or DAT rate stereo, 16/24 bits), it is
   in the same league as MPEG-4 AAC.  Vorbis is also intended for lower
   and higher sample rates (from 8kHz telephony to 192kHz digital
   masters) and a range of channel representations (monaural,
   polyphonic, stereo, quadraphonic, 5.1, ambisonic, or up to 255
   discrete channels).

   Vorbis encoded audio is generally encapsulated within an Ogg format
   bitstream [11], which provides framing and synchronization.  For the
   purposes of RTP transport, this layer is unnecessary, and so raw
   Vorbis packets are used in the payload.

1.1.  Conformance and Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.
   Requirements apply to all implementations unless otherwise stated.

   An implementation is a software module that supports one of the media
   types defined in this document.  Software modules may support
   multiple media types, but conformance is considered individually for
   each type.

   Implementations that fail to satisfy one or more "MUST" requirements
   are considered non-compliant.  Implementations that satisfy all
   "MUST" requirements, but fail to satisfy one or more "SHOULD"
   requirements, are said to be "conditionally compliant".  All other
   implementations are "unconditionally compliant".

2.  Payload Format

   For RTP based transport of Vorbis encoded audio the standard RTP
   header is followed by a 4 octets payload header, then the payload
   data.  The payload headers are used to associate the Vorbis data with
   its associated decoding codebooks as well as indicating if the
   following packet contains fragmented Vorbis data and/or the number of
   whole Vorbis data frames.  The payload data contains the raw Vorbis
   bitstream information.  There are 3 types of Vorbis data, an RTP
   payload MUST contain just one of them at a time.

2.1.  RTP Header

   The format of the RTP header is specified in [2] and shown in Figure
   Figure 1.  This payload format uses the fields of the header in a
   manner consistent with that specification.

                           Figure 1: RTP Header

   The RTP header begins with an octet of fields (V, P, X, and CC) to
   support specialized RTP uses (see [2] and [3] for details).  For
   Vorbis RTP, the following values are used.

   Version (V): 2 bits

   This field identifies the version of RTP.  The version used by this
   specification is two (2).

   Padding (P): 1 bit

   Padding MAY be used with this payload format according to section 5.1
   of [2].

   Extension (X): 1 bit

   The Extension bit is used in accordance with [2].

   CSRC count (CC): 4 bits

   The CSRC count is used in accordance with [2].

   Marker (M): 1 bit

   Set to zero.  Audio silence suppression not used.  This conforms to
   section 4.1 of [10].

Internet-Draft          Vorbis RTP Payload Format               Feb 2008


   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits

   An RTP profile for a class of applications is expected to assign a
   payload type for this format, or a dynamically allocated payload type
   SHOULD be chosen which designates the payload as Vorbis.

   Sequence number: 16 bits

   The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet sent,
   and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore
   packet sequence.  This field is detailed further in [2].

   Timestamp: 32 bits

   A timestamp representing the sampling time of the first sample of the
   first Vorbis packet in the RTP payload.  The clock frequency MUST be
   set to the sample rate of the encoded audio data and is conveyed out-
   of-band (e.g. as an SDP parameter).

   SSRC/CSRC identifiers:

   These two fields, 32 bits each with one SSRC field and a maximum of
   16 CSRC fields, are as defined in [2].

2.2.  Payload Header

   The 4 octets following the RTP Header section are the Payload Header.
   This header is split into a number of bitfields detailing the format
   of the following payload data packets.

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Ident: 24 bits

   This 24 bit field is used to associate the Vorbis data to a decoding
   Configuration.  It is stored as network byte order integer.

   Fragment type (F): 2 bits

   This field is set according to the following list

Internet-Draft          Vorbis RTP Payload Format               Feb 2008


      0 = Not Fragmented
      1 = Start Fragment
      2 = Continuation Fragment
      3 = End Fragment

   Vorbis Data Type (VDT): 2 bits

   This field specifies the kind of Vorbis data stored in this RTP
   packet.  There are currently three different types of Vorbis
   payloads.  Each packet MUST contain only a single type of Vorbis
   packet (e.g. you must not aggregate configuration and comment packets
   in the same RTP payload)

      0 = Raw Vorbis payload
      1 = Vorbis Packed Configuration payload
      2 = Legacy Vorbis Comment payload
      3 = Reserved

   The packets with a VDT of value 3 MUST be ignored

   The last 4 bits represent the number of complete packets in this
   payload.  This provides for a maximum number of 15 Vorbis packets in
   the payload.  If the payload contains fragmented data the number of
   packets MUST be set to 0.

2.3.  Payload Data

   Raw Vorbis packets are currently unbounded in length, application
   profiles will likely define a practical limit.  Typical Vorbis packet
   sizes range from very small (2-3 bytes) to quite large (8-12
   kilobytes).  The reference implementation [12] typically produces
   packets less than ~800 bytes, except for the setup header packets
   which are ~4-12 kilobytes.  Within an RTP context, to avoid
   fragmentation, the Vorbis data packet size SHOULD be kept
   sufficiently small so that after adding the RTP and payload headers,
   the complete RTP packet is smaller than the path MTU.

                       Figure 3: Payload Data Header

   Each Vorbis payload packet starts with a two octet length header,
   which is used to represent the size in bytes of the following data
   payload, followed by the raw Vorbis data padded to the nearest byte

   boundary, as explained by the vorbis specification [10].  The length
   value is stored as network byte order integer.

   For payloads which consist of multiple Vorbis packets the payload
   data consists of the packet length followed by the packet data for
   each of the Vorbis packets in the payload.

   The Vorbis packet length header is the length of the Vorbis data
   block only and does not include the length field.

   The payload packing of the Vorbis data packets MUST follow the
   guidelines set-out in [3] where the oldest Vorbis packet occurs
   immediately after the RTP packet header.  Subsequent Vorbis packets,
   if any, MUST follow in temporal order.

   Channel mapping of the audio is in accordance with the Vorbis I
   Specification [10].

2.4.  Example RTP Packet

   Here is an example RTP payload containing two Vorbis packets.

                    Figure 4: Example Raw Vorbis Packet

   The payload data section of the RTP packet begins with the 24 bit
   Ident field followed by the one octet bitfield header, which has the
   number of Vorbis frames set to 2.  Each of the Vorbis data frames is
   prefixed by the two octets length field.  The Packet Type and
   Fragment Type are set to 0.  The Configuration that will be used to
   decode the packets is the one indexed by the ident value.

3.  Configuration Headers

   Unlike other mainstream audio codecs Vorbis has no statically
   configured probability model.  Instead, it packs all entropy decoding
   configuration, Vector Quantization and Huffman models into a data
   block that must be transmitted to the decoder along with the
   compressed data.  A decoder also requires information detailing the
   number of audio channels, bitrates and similar information to
   configure itself for a particular compressed data stream.  These two
   blocks of information are often referred to collectively as the
   "codebooks" for a Vorbis stream, and are nominally included as
   special "header" packets at the start of the compressed data.  In
   addition, the Vorbis I specification [10] requires the presence of a
   comment header packet which gives simple metadata about the stream,
   but this information is not required for decoding the frame sequence.

   Thus these two codebook header packets must be received by the
   decoder before any audio data can be interpreted.  These requirements
   pose problems in RTP, which is often used over unreliable transports.

   Since this information must be transmitted reliably and, as the RTP
   stream may change certain configuration data mid-session, there are
   different methods for delivering this configuration data to a client,
   both in-band and out-of-band which is detailed below.  In order to
   set up an initial state for the client application the configuration
   MUST be conveyed via the signalling channel used to setup the
   session.  One example of such signalling is SDP [5] with the Offer/
   Answer Model [8].  Changes to the configuration MAY be communicated
   via a re-invite, conveying new SDP, or sent in-band in the RTP
   channel.  Implementations MUST support in-band delivery of updated
   codebooks, and SHOULD support out-of-band codebook update using a new
   SDP file.  The changes may be due to different codebooks as well as
   different bitrates of the RTP stream.

   For non chained streams, the recommended Configuration delivery
   method is inline the Packed Configuration (Section 3.1.1) in the SDP
   as explained in the IANA considerations (Section 7.1).

   The 24 bit Ident field is used to map which Configuration will be

Internet-Draft          Vorbis RTP Payload Format               Feb 2008


   used to decode a packet.  When the Ident field changes, it indicates
   that a change in the stream has taken place.  The client application
   MUST have in advance the correct configuration and if the client
   detects a change in the Ident value and does not have this
   information it MUST NOT decode the raw Vorbis data associated until
   it fetches the correct Configuration.

3.1.  In-band Header Transmission

   The Packed Configuration (Section 3.1.1) Payload is sent in-band with
   the packet type bits set to match the Vorbis Data Type.  Clients MUST
   be capable of dealing with fragmentation and periodic re-transmission
   of [14] the configuration headers.  The RTP timestamp value MUST
   reflect the transmission time of the first data packet for which this
   configuration applies.

3.1.1.  Packed Configuration

   A Vorbis Packed Configuration is indicated with the Vorbis Data Type
   field set to 1.  Of the three headers defined in the Vorbis I
   specification [10], the Identification and the Setup MUST be packed
   as they are, while the comment header MAY be replaced with a dummy
   one.

   The packed configuration follows a generic way to store Xiph codec
   configurations: The first field stores the number of the following
   packets minus one (count field), the next ones represent the size of
   the headers (length fields), the headers immediately follow the list
   of length fields.  The size of the last header is implicit.

   The count and the length fields are encoded using the following
   logic: the data is in network byte order, every byte has the most
   significant bit used as flag and the following 7 used to store the
   value.  The first N bit are to be taken, where N is number of bits
   needed to represent the value, taken modulo 7, and stored in the
   first byte.  If there are more bits, the flag bit is set to 1 and the
   subsequent 7bit are stored in the following byte, if there are
   remaining bits set the flag to 1 and the same procedure is repeated.
   The ending byte has the flag bit set to 0.  In order to decode it is
   enough to iterate over the bytes until the flag bit set to 0, for
   every byte the data is added to the accumulated value multiplied by
   128.

   The headers are packed in the same order they are present in ogg:
   Identification, Comment, Setup.

   The 2 byte length tag defines the length of the packed headers as the
   sum of the Configuration, Comment and Setup lengths.

   The Ident field is set with the value that will be used by the Raw
   Payload Packets to address this Configuration.  The Fragment type is
   set to 0 since the packet bears the full Packed configuration, the
   number of packet is set to 1.

3.2.  Out of Band Transmission

   The following packet definition MUST be used when Configuration is
   inlined in the SDP.

3.2.1.  Packed Headers

   As mentioned above the RECOMMENDED delivery vector for Vorbis
   configuration data is via a retrieval method that can be performed
   using a reliable transport protocol.  As the RTP headers are not
   required for this method of delivery the structure of the
   configuration data is slightly different.  The packed header starts
   with a 32 bit (network byte ordered) count field which details the
   number of packed headers that are contained in the bundle.  Next is
   the Packed header payload for each chained Vorbis stream.

                      Figure 7: Packed Headers Detail

   The key difference between the in-band format and this one, is that
   there is no need for the payload header octet.  In this figure the
   comment has a size bigger than 127 bytes.

3.3.  Loss of Configuration Headers

   Unlike the loss of raw Vorbis payload data, loss of a configuration
   header lead to a situation where it will not be possible to
   successfully decode the stream.  Implementations MAY try to recover
   from error by requesting again the missing Configuration or, if the
   delivery method is in-band, by buffering the payloads waiting for the
   Configuration needed to decode them.  The baseline reaction SHOULD be
   either reset or end the RTP session.

4.  Comment Headers

   With the Vorbis Data Type flag set to 2, this indicates that the
   packet contain the comment metadata, such as artist name, track title
   and so on.  These metadata messages are not intended to be fully
   descriptive but to offer basic track/song information.  Clients MAY
   ignore it completely.  The details on the format of the comments can
   be found in the Vorbis documentation [10].

                         Figure 8: Comment Packet

   The 2 bytes length field is necessary since this packet could be
   fragmented.

5.  Frame Packetization

   Each RTP payload contains either one Vorbis packet fragment, or an
   integer number of complete Vorbis packets (up to a maximum of 15
   packets, since the number of packets is defined by a 4 bit value).

   Any Vorbis data packet that is less than path MTU SHOULD be bundled
   in the RTP payload with as many Vorbis packets as will fit, up to a
   maximum of 15, except when such bundling would exceed an
   application's desired transmission latency.  Path MTU is detailed in
   [6] and [7].

   A fragmented packet has a zero in the last four bits of the payload
   header.  The first fragment will set the Fragment type to 1.  Each
   fragment after the first will set the Fragment type to 2 in the
   payload header.  The consecutive fragments MUST be sent without any
   other payloads being sent between the first and the last fragment.
   The RTP payload containing the last fragment of the Vorbis packet
   will have the Fragment type set to 3.  To maintain the correct
   sequence for fragmented packet reception the timestamp field of
   fragmented packets MUST be the same as the first packet sent, with

   the sequence number incremented as normal for the subsequent RTP
   payloads, this will affect the RTCP jitter measurement.  The length
   field shows the fragment length.

   The Fragment type field is set to 2 and the number of packets field
   is set to 0.  For large Vorbis fragments there can be several of this
   type of payloads.  The maximum packet size SHOULD be no greater than
   the path MTU, including all RTP and payload headers.  The sequence
   number has been incremented by one but the timestamp field remains
   the same as the initial payload.

              Figure 11: Example Fragmented Packet (Packet 3)

   This is the last Vorbis fragment payload.  The Fragment type is set
   to 3 and the packet count remains set to 0.  As in the previous
   payloads the timestamp remains set to the first payload timestamp in
   the sequence and the sequence number has been incremented.

5.2.  Packet Loss

   As there is no error correction within the Vorbis stream, packet loss
   will result in a loss of signal.  Packet loss is more of an issue for
   fragmented Vorbis packets as the client will have to cope with the
   handling of the Fragment Type.  In case of loss of fragments the
   client MUST discard all the remaining Vorbis fragments and decode the
   incomplete packet.  If we use the fragmented Vorbis packet example
   above and the first RTP payload is lost the client MUST detect that
   the next RTP payload has the packet count field set to 0 and the
   Fragment type 2 and MUST drop it.  The next RTP payload, which is the
   final fragmented packet, MUST be dropped in the same manner.  If the
   missing RTP payload is the last, the received two fragments will be
   kept and the incomplete Vorbis packet decoded.

   Loss of any of the Configuration fragment will result in the loss of
   the full Configuration packet with the result detailed in the Loss of
   Configuration Headers (Section 3.3) section.

7.  SDP related considerations

   The following paragraphs define the mapping of the parameters
   described in the IANA considerations section and their usage in the
   Offer/Answer Model [8].  In order to be forward compatible the
   implementation MUST ignore unknown parameters.

7.1.  Mapping Media Type Parameters into SDP

   The information carried in the Media Type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [5], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is
   used to specify sessions the mapping are as follows:

   o  The type name ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The subtype name ("vorbis") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
      name.

   o  The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate.

   o  The parameter "channels" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as channel count.

   o  The mandated parameters "configuration" MUST be included in the
      SDP "a=fmtp" attribute.


   If the stream comprises chained Vorbis files and all of them are
   known in advance, the Configuration Packet for each file SHOULD be
   passed to the client using the configuration attribute.

   The port value is specified by the server application bound to the
   address specified in the c= line.  The channel count value specified
   in the rtpmap attribute SHOULD match the current Vorbis stream or
   considered the maximum number of channels to be expected.  The
   timestamp clock rate MUST be a multiple of the sample rate, different
   payload number MUST be used if the clock rate changes.  The
   Configuration payload delivers the exact information, thus the SDP
   information SHOULD be considered as a hint.  An example is found
   below.

7.1.1.  SDP Example

   The following example shows a basic SDP single stream.  The first
   configuration packet is inlined in the SDP, other configurations
   could be fetched at any time from the URIs provided.  The inline
   base64 [9] configuration string is folded in this example due to RFC
   line length limitations.
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
      m=audio RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 vorbis/44100/2
      a=fmtp:98 configuration=AAAAAZ2f4g9NAh4aAXZvcmJpcwA...;

   Note that the payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in
   upper case.  Media Type subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.

   These names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly,
   parameter names are case-insensitive both in Media Type types and in
   the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.  The a=fmtp line is
   a single line even if it is shown as multiple lines in this document
   for clarity.

7.2.  Usage with the SDP Offer/Answer Model

   The are no negotiable parameters.  All the of them are declarative.

8.  Congestion Control

   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP
   data apply to vorbis audio over RTP as well.  See the RTP
   specification [2] and any applicable RTP profile (e.g., [3]).  Audio
   data can be encoded using a range of different bit rates, so it is
   possible to adapt network bandwidth by adjusting the encoder bit rate
   in real time or by having multiple copies of content encoded at
   different bit rates.

9.  Example

   The following example shows a common usage pattern that MAY be
   applied in such situation, the main scope of this section is to
   explain better usage of the transmission vectors.

9.1.  Stream Radio

   This is one of the most common situation: one single server streaming
   content in multicast, the clients may start a session at random time.
   The content itself could be a mix of live stream, as the webjockey's
   voice, and stored streams as the music she plays.

   In this situation we don't know in advance how many codebooks we will
   use.  The clients can join anytime and users expect to start
   listening to the content in a short time.

   On join the client will receive the current Configuration necessary
   to decode the current stream inlined in the SDP so that the decoding
   will start immediately after.

   When the streamed content changes the new Configuration is sent in-
   band before the actual stream and the Configuration that has to be
   sent inline in the SDP updated.  Since the in-band method is
   unreliable, an out of band fallback is provided.

   The client may choose to fetch the Configuration from the alternate
   source as soon as it discovers a Configuration packet got lost in-

   band or use selective retransmission [13], if the server supports the
   feature.

   A serverside optimization would be to keep an hash list of the
   Configurations per session to avoid packing all of them and send the
   same Configuration with different Ident tags

   A clientside optimization would be to keep a tag list of the
   Configurations per session and don't process configuration packets
   already known.

10.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using this payload format are subject to the security
   considerations discussed in the RTP specification [2], the base64
   specification [9] and the URI Generic syntax specification [4].
   Among other considerations, this implies that the confidentiality of
   the media stream is archieved by using encryption.  Because the data
   compression used with this payload format is applied end-to-end,
   encryption may be performed on the compressed data.
